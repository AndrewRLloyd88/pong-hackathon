## FAQ

### Why are my assets not showing up?

All assets must be imported!

### Where do I get started?

I Recommend starting in src/scenes/game.js, edit the menu screen, and win screen after you complete your game.

## What we're trying to achieve

This starter template is meant to be a kickoff spot for a full-fledged PhaserJS game project.

- Simple template with asset pipeline to help you get started
- Ability to pivot into turn based games, action games, or any other kind of game.
- Good example code for various common game UX patterns.
- Livereload dev server using Parcel Bundler
- Support for `html`, `pug`, `md`, `js`, `jsx`, `ts`, `tsx`, `json`, `css`, `scss`, `postcss`, `less`, and various
  image filetypes, font files, and more. (See [Parcel](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel)'s documentation)
- Yarn for faster package resolution

## Part 1 - Core Requirements

The requirements in this section will guide you in building a minimum viable product (MVP) application. The application you'll build here will let you walk away with a basic product that users will find interesting and appealing.

These core requirements are constructed so that most participants will be able to create a finished product. However, in order to win, you will need to go above and beyond the core requirements. Please see the "Stretch Goals" section for suggestions on how to improve on the basic product

Core Architecture

You must build a frontend web application.

There must be no backend server/serverless components.

## Part 2 - Refining the UX & optional "help" sections

From Rocket55's site:
UX is important because it tries to fulfill the user's needs. It aims to provide positive experiences that keep users loyal to the product or brand. Additionally, a meaningful user experience allows you to define customer journeys on your website that are most conducive to business success.

In order for your app to have good UX, each part should be either intuitive or clearly & concisely explained.

Here are some more suggestions to help you win this section of the challenge:

onboarding tutorial

help text

info bubbles/tooltips

helpful hints

clear notifications

## Part 3 - Landing page + promoting on social media

Why we have this section
Projects without landing pages end up being COMPLETELY invisible to recruiters & employers. If they are not promoted on social media are RARELY seen by recruiters & employers.

Part 3.A: You must create a landing page for your app that clearly explains your product. Google "Product Landing Page" for examples of standard landing pages for products.

Part 3.B: promote your project on social media! LinkedIn and Twitter are great places to be. Make sure you paste your posts + tweets inside the Discord server! and tag Mintbean!!!

Here are some fully-tested LinkedIn post templates you can use to show off your work!
